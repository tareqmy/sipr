# Follow-up tasks

Work found while fixing something else and left out of that change so it
stayed one logical fix. Each entry stands alone and can be handed to an
agent as is. Delete an entry when its fix lands.

The SIPp C++ source is at `../../cprojects/sipp/src` (relative to the
repo root). Read it to confirm the behavior, and never copy it (GPL).
Every task follows the same loop:

1. Write a failing test first, preferably an interop test against real
   sipp. `jumps_and_message_indices_skip_labels_like_real_sipp` in
   `tests/interop.rs` shows the UAC-against-a-UDP-sink pattern.
2. Fix it, then update `docs/SIPP_COMPAT.md` §6 (mark the open item
   fixed) and the Unreleased section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Run the gates:

   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all -- --check
   cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
   cargo test --workspace
   cargo deny check
   SIPP_BIN=../../cprojects/sipp/sipp cargo test -p sipr --test interop
   ```

4. Commit per `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`, with the scope given below.

No open entries.
